WatchFile(s)
=========

A python-based console script for watching files and running 
utilities if they were modified.

- You can use it, for example, when you are making a program
or something and 
- Well, it is versatile, pretty sure you can find an use 
case for this eventually.

- This was made for fun! I hope it will be useful for you 
somehow!
